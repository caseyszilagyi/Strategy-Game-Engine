### Project goals
- Have a working game engine that can run when given properties files
- Design a framework that is extendable to similar kinds of games
- implement all basic expectations
- complete half of mild expectations
- do at least one of the challenging implementations
### Project Emphasis
- Make property files with maximum emphasis on abstractability.
- More focus on making the abstractions rather than on front end design. Not really interested in having very good animation

### Project Progress

#### Sprint 1 (Test)

- make a property file reader which can parse the basics for a game
- come up with a unified structure for all kinds of properties files
- come up with a unified structure for all kinds of classes
- Come up with basic model design for the game
- Know which challenges we will go with
- Know which mild requirements we'll go with


#### Sprint 2 (Basic)

- make an initial game (chess)
- Working engine, but still open to smaller modifications. Can have bugs but should have a decent idea as to how to fix these bugs

#### Sprint 3 (Complete)

- implement other games (checkers, othello, tic-tak-toe)

#### "Walk" 4 (Extra time)

- Add the ability to play against a computer
- Animate view
    - Piece taking (think wizard chess)
    - piece moving

### Highlights
- how to deal with different pieces and win conditions
- tik-tac-toe?
- Focus on the questions that people would have when learning about a game, becasue that will help us think about abstractions
