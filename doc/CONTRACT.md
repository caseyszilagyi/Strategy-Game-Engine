# Team Contract

------
## General
- Always do your best to show up to meetings
    - If you can't make it, make sure someone close to your part of the project catches you up
    
- Share design implementation details, especially when facing problems or tricky
situations
  
- Try to focus on writing clean understandable code rather than hacking a buggy program
together
  
- If you have issues with someone else's code, try to bring it up to them over Zoom
rather than through Slack messages. If the issue isn't fixed, then it is acceptable
  to confer with the rest of the team
  
## API
- Warn teammates of any major API changes in your code that can affect their implementation. 
- Write clear Javadoc comments for APIs that teammates will rely heavily on, especially if the behavior of the API is complex. Be sure to specify any assumptions or expectations of that API. 
- Ask a teammate to create methods that you find that you need in their API rather than attempting to create them yourself. 
- Warn teammates of any renaming of methods and classes, even when automatic refactoring can be used. 

## Git
- Work on separate branches for each new features
- Do not necessarily have to use merge requests, but make sure that there is no merge conflict and that the code behaves correctly before pushing to master. 
- Attribute commits to the appropriate issue or milestone items to track progress.
