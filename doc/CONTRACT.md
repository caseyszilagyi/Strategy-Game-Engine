- Always do your best to show up to meetings
    - If you can't make it, make sure someone close to your part of the project catches you up
    
- Share design implementation details, especially when facing problems or tricky
situations
  
- Try to focus on writing clean understandable code rather than hacking a buggy program
together
  
- If you have issues with someone else's code, try to bring it up to them over zoom
rather than through slack messages. If the issue isn't fixed, then it is acceptable
  to confer with the rest of the team
