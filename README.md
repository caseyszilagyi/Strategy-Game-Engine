### Notes/Assumptions

Assumptions or Simplifications:
-  The implementation of the finiteSlide class makes the assumption that finite slide moves will be in either a directly
diagonal direction, or horizontal/vertical. This is because anything other than these cases makes
it unclear what path the piece takes, making it unworkable with the current information that the
class gets. If any movements are given that aren't directly vertical/horizontal/diagonal, the potential 
   moves may not be calculated properly
